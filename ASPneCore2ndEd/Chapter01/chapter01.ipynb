    "ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, open source, web application framework that you can use to quickly build dynamic, server-side rendered applications. You can also use ASP.NET Core to create HTTP APIs that can be consumed by mobile applications, by browser-based single-page applications such as Angular and React, or by other backend applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core provides structure, helper functions, and a framework for building applications, which saves you having to write a lot of this code yourself. The ASP.NET Core framework code then calls into your “handlers” which, in turn, call methods in your application’s business logic, as shown in figure 1.1. This business logic is the core of your application. You can interact with other services here, such as databases or remote APIs, but your business logic does not typically depend directly on ASP.NET Core.\n",

    "Well, it’s perfectly possible to build a static web application without the use of a web framework, but its capabilities will be limited. As soon as you want to provide any kind of security or dynamism, you’ll likely run into difficulties, and the original simplicity that enticed you will fade before your eyes.\n",

Without a dynamic framework, it wouldn’t be possible to log in to websites or to display any sort of personalized data on a page. In short, websites like Amazon, eBay, and Stack Overflow (seen in figure 1.2) wouldn’t be possible.\n",

    "The development of ASP.NET Core was motivated by the desire to create a web framework with four main goals:\n",
    "- To be run and developed cross-platform\n",
    "- To have a modular architecture for easier maintenance\n",
    "- To be developed completely as open source software\n",
    "- To be applicable to current trends in web development, such as client-side applications and deployment to cloud environments\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve all these goals, Microsoft needed a platform that could provide underlying libraries for creating basic objects such as lists and dictionaries, and for performing, for example, simple file operations. Up to this point, ASP.NET development had always been focused, and dependent, on the Windows-only .NET Framework. For ASP.NET Core, Microsoft created a lightweight platform that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS called .NET Core (and subsequently .NET 5.0), as shown in figure 1.3.\n"
